"""Max consecutive-run length along a time-like dim satisfying a threshold comparison.

For each selected data variable, computes the longest run of consecutive
entries along the time dim (``time``, or a lead-time dim such as ``step``)
satisfying ``value <comparison> threshold`` — e.g. a dry-spell length with
``--comparison lt`` on precipitation, or a wet-spell / heatwave length with
``--comparison ge``. Data variables that don't carry the time dim pass
through untouched.
