"""Compute the percentage of ensemble members exceeding a fixed threshold.

For each selected data variable, computes the percentage of entries along
``--dim`` (e.g. ``number``, aliased to ``member`` in the dim ontology, for an
ECMWF/GEFS ensemble) satisfying ``value <comparison> threshold``, per
remaining grid cell/step. Data variables that don't carry ``--dim`` pass
through untouched.
